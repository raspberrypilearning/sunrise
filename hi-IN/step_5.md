## Infinite animation

Let's make the animation keep repeating forever.

+ If you want the sun to rise and then set, just add more keyframes to your animation:
    
        @keyframes sunrise {
            0%  
            33% 
            66% 
            100%
        }
        
    
    This means that the animation starts and ends with the sun at the bottom of the sky, and stays at the top from 33% until 66% of the animation.

+ Now you just need to add the word `infinite` to the `#sun` animation to make it loop forever:

+ Test out your animation. Does the sun keep rising and setting?
