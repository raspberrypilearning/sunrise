## Animating the sky

Animation isn't just for movement. Let's animate the sky to turn dark at night.



+ Add an animation called `sky` to your CSS:

    ```
    @keyframes sky {
        0%
        100%
    }
    ```

    Notice that this time you're animating the colour of the sky, and not the position.

+ Add code to your sky, to tell it to use your new animation:

    ```
    animation: sky 10s;
    ```
