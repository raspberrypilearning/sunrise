## Den Sonnenaufgang animieren

To animate your sunrise, you need to define how the sun moves and how long it takes to rise.

To do this you define a list of **key frames**. Each key frame defines the CSS properties of an element at a particular point in an animation.

+ First, you need to use `@keyframes` to create a new animation called sunrise.
    
    Add this CSS code to the end of your `style.css` file:
    
        @keyframes sunrise {
            0%
            100%
        }
        
    
    This code tells the sun where to position itself at the start (`0%`) and the end (`100%`) of the animation.
    
    Because the sun is inside the sky `div`, the `top` and `left` positions you give are within to the sky, with `top: 100%` being the bottom of the sky, and not the bottom of the webpage.

+ Now that you have created a `sunrise` animation, you just need to tell your sun to use it!
    
    Add the highlighted code to your sun's CSS:
    
    ![Screenshot](images/sunrise-sunrise.png)
    
    This tells the sun to spend 10 seconds animating a sunrise.

+ To run the animation again in Trinket, just click **Autorun**.
