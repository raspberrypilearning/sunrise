## Animating the sky

Animation isn't just for movement. Let's animate the sky to turn dark at night.

+ Add an animation called `sky` to your CSS:
    
        @keyframes sky {
            0%
            100%
        }
        
    
    Notice that this time you're animating the colour of the sky, and not the position.

+ Add code to your sky, to tell it to use your new animation:
    
        animation: sky 10s;
        
    
    ![لقطة الشاشة](images/sunrise-sky.png)

+ Click **Autorun** to test your animation.
